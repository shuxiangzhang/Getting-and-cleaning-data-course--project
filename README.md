# Getting-and-cleaning-data-course--project
This repo is created for the purpose of submitting a course project. My Run_analysis.R script has basically done a few things as follows:

1. Download the project data set from spicied website and unzip it to a folder
2. Read data from files into R
3. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
6. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
8. Export the resulting file named tidy.txt into a specified folder
